## Testing GitHub Pages

Just learning about using GitHub Pages for personal blogging. Please ignore me.

Known:

- Rumor has it that index.html is used as the home page instead of README.md, if it exists. Don't know which I should use, though.

Already having questions:

- Commit directly to master *vs* create branch and pull request: I'm editing this README.md directly in the master branch. But I vaguely remember 5 minutes ago I was taught to create a branch, commit, do pull request, and merge, then delete branch, to make changes. I'm already confused.

To do:

- Customize/build theme.
- Learn how blogging actually works on GitHub Pages. How to create a new post? How to avoid generating unnecessary noise for the internet? Privacy and copyright? Content rules and code of conduct? Considerations for using multiple langauges in the same post? 測試正體中文，標點符號應置中。そして日本語の句読点：、・。
- Find out about that light clacking noise coming from my PC...*shudder* (And how to use emoticons, if available.)

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/cavealex/cavealex.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/cavealex/cavealex.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
